## Hi there 👋

I'm Nadine, a former biomedical analyst🔬 who is currently studying medical informatics⌨️.

I study part-time and work part-time in IT customer support for a diagnostic laboratory.

I like doing projects to deepen my current programming skills in Python, but I also try to learn the basics of Web App Development
